			Thank you for using my app ðŸ™‚. Making this is a learning process for me so please
			understand if something doesn't work. If you notice any issues, have suggestions, or

			<h3>Redeem Codes</h3>
		</a>
		<p>
			The app searches the web for active redemption codes so sometimes its data is
			incorrect or outdated, but should be corrected promptly. Username/password sign in is
			WiP to prevent user data loss; avoid clearing cookies and site data in the meantime or
			checkboxes will be reset.

		<h3>Resource Timer</h3>

			This was an earlier project that I don't intend to develop further or add ZZZ
			functionality unless demand is high. Let me know if you'd like to see it added.
